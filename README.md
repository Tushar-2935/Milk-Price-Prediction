# Milk-Price-Prediction
🥛 Milk Price Forecasting Dashboard

This project predicts daily milk prices in Maharashtra (2015–2026) using time-series forecasting (Prophet) and supervised machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression, Hybrid models).

We also quantify uncertainty with Monte Carlo simulation and allow scenario analysis (best-case, worst-case) through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

🚀 Features

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of milk prices and macroeconomic factors

🔮 Forecasting with Prophet (best model, ~1.5% MAPE)

🤖 Supervised ML models:

Random Forest

XGBoost

Linear Regression

Hybrid Ensemble

🎲 Monte Carlo simulation to estimate uncertainty bands & probabilities

⚖️ Scenario analysis (feed cost, energy cost, rainfall, inflation, transport, labor rate, local production, global prices, exports)

🖥️ Streamlit dashboard for monthly forecasts, scenario adjustments, and visualization

📊 Results

Prophet outperformed other models with MAPE ≈ 1.5%.

Forecast shows stable upward trend in 2026, with moderate uncertainty (±2 Rs).
